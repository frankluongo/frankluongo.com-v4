_"Hey, Frank, what hardware/software do you use?"_ is a question that I imagine people will ask me someday. Therefore, before they even do, I've taken the time to tell you.

- [Logitech Anywhere Mouse][2]
- [Dell Ultra HD 4k Monitor][3]
- [Vava USB Hub][4]

## My Hardware

### 2019 MacBook Pro

#### Pros

- Powerful enough to handle whatever I throw at it
- Portable enough to take anywhere

#### Cons

- It only has 256GB of Storage, which is not enough. I should have splurged on the memory and I'd encourage anyone else to get at least 1TB
- It's a little buggy. I've found it to be full of little issues from the trackpad/keyboard taking an extra minute to fire up to taking a while to start up

### Sandisk External Drive

This is great at compensating for the lack of memory on the computer. But I'd recommend buying something with more storage like the [Samsung T5][7].

### Spacegray Apple Keyboard

This is totally frivolous and unnecessary, but I love it.

### Logitech Anywhere Mouse

This mouse works 90% of the time. I have noticed occasional bugginess depending on where the receiver for it is and its battery level.

### Dell Ultra HD 4k Monitor

This monitor is dope. The version I have is a few years old, so I'd recommend getting the [newer model][8]

### Vava USB Hub

If you own a MacBook Pro with USB-C Hubs only, you have to have this.

## My Software & Apps

### Things App

The [Things App][9] from Cultured Code is what I use to keep track of all my ongoing projects. I have each freelance client in their own Area, with their respective projects listed under that area. It was a little pricey but it's a one-time purchase which drew me in.

### Habitify

I use [Habitify][10] to track my habits for each that I'd like to accomplish. I keep things like reading a certain number of pages, taking vitamins, and journaling in here to make sure I don't forget about them.

### Google Drive

Google Docs are life. They're by far the easiest way to create and share documents with clients

### Notion

The [Notion App][11] is my personal Wiki, Client Database, and so much more. I keep everything in there that doesn't fit in my brain.

### Wave

I used [Wave][12] to bill clients because it's free. For personal finances, I keep a Google Spreadsheet with my weekly spending, among other things to keep from recklessly blowing my money on beyblades.
