            <h3 className="h3 black">The Problem</h3>
            <p>
              The founders of Twin Waves Wellness reached out to me to create
              their branding and digital presence. The two co-founders recently
              started a new chiropractic practice in San Diego and needed to get
              their name out there in a big way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 className="h3 black">The Design</h3>
            <p>
              The look and feel of the brand was a collaborative effort between
              myself and Courtney Mathis. We coordinated colors and typography,
              while she made the logomark.
            </p>
            <br />
            {/* <Img fluid={hero} /> */}
            <br />
            <Grid xsCols="2" data-align-center>
              {/* <Img fluid={footer} /> */}
              <p>
                The goal for Twin Waves was to make the visitors to their
                website feel like theyâ€™re at a beach. We want people to feel all
                the positive parts of being near the ocean, without getting sand
                everywhere.
              </p>
            </Grid>
            <br />
            <p>
              The end result is a site that feels calming yet bright and
              informative yet fun.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 className="h3 black">The Development</h3>
            <p>
              This site is built using Gatsby Js with WordPress serving as a
              headless CMS.
            </p>
            <br />
            <Grid xsCols="2" data-align-center>
              <p>
                There is an underlying CSS Design system, with the React
                Component using CSS Modules to tie styles to a specific scope.
              </p>
              {/* <Img fluid={ui} /> */}
            </Grid>
            <br />
            <p>
              The user-facing portion of the website is hosted on Vercel, while
              the WordPress site is at Digital Ocean. When users make changes,
              the Frontend is updated via Webhooks.
