              Melanie Krummel has been providing independent jewelry appraisals
              since 1996. The office is located in Havre de Grace, Maryland with
              convenient on-site services with reputable retail partners
              throughout Maryland, Washington DC, Delaware and Virginia.

            <h3 className="h3 black">The Problem</h3>
            <p>
              The Jewelry Appraisals, Inc. website was in desperate need of a
              refresh. The site had not been updated since its original creation
              in the early 2000’s. The client brought me in to modernize their
              digital experience.
            </p>
            <br />
            {/* <Img fluid={home} /> */}
            <br />
            <h3 className="h3 black">The Solution</h3>
            <Grid xsCols="2" data-align-center>
              <p>
                In an effort to move quickly, the new website was built in HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript. However, as the client’s needs progressed,
                it made more sense to move the platform over to WordPress.
              </p>
              {/* <Img fluid={services} /> */}
            </Grid>
            <br />
            <Grid xsCols="2" data-align-center>
              {/* <Img fluid={ui} /> */}
              <p>
                Now, the site is built on a custom WordPress theme, allowing the
                team at Jewelry Appraisals, Inc. to edit content themselves
                without the need for assistance.
              </p>
            </Grid>
          </MainContent>
