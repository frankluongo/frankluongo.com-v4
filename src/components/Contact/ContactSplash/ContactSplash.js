              I started my career as a visual designer for RevZilla.com in 2013.
              I worked there until June of 2019, moving from design to user
              experience to development. As a visual designer, I created
              promotional graphics and new site features. On the UX team, I
              conducted site audits and built prototypes for user testing.
              Lastly, as a member of the tech team, I helped maintain a Ruby on
              Rails admin and an Elixir/Phoenix eCommerce Application that used
              ES6 JavaScript and SCSS.
            </p>

              In June of 2019, I decided to “shake things up” in my life and
              moved to Denver, Colorado to work for the state's Legislative
              Council Services. While there, I worked as a UI Developer
              designing and building web apps with React and Rails.
            </p>
            <p>
              In March of 2020, I left the Legislative Council (and Denver, due
              to COVID), and began working remotely for O'Reilly Media.
              Currently, I help to maintain and improve the Search experience
              for the O'Reilly Learning Platform in a React/Redux Web
              Application.
